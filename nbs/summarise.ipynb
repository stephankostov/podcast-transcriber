They discuss how mathematical concepts such as patterns, structures, and symmetries are present in various forms of creative expression, including literature, music, and poetry. The conversation covers topics such as the use of prime numbers in haiku poetry, the role of vibrations in creating pleasing musical compositions, and the ways in which mathematicians can appreciate the beauty and elegance of literature. Additionally, they talk about the potential benefits of incorporating math appreciation courses into high school curriculums, the importance of making math accessible and engaging, and the limitations of the traditional scientific method in economics. Throughout the episode, the speakers emphasize the importance of finding the right balance between freedom and constraint in order to create something truly special, and demonstrate the power and wonder of math in real-world applications.'"

      "SPEAKER_01: A brand new book is called Once Upon a Prime, and it dives into the magical overlap between literature and mathematics. Back in January, I interviewed mathematician Stephen Strokatz, and we had an idea to teach Math Appreciation, a course about the elegance and beauty of what math can do. In Sarah's return visit to the show, I'm hoping to explore how the material in her book can actually bring math to life. So, Sarah, you were on the show back in 2021, and that was a conversation that really sticks with me. We talked about all sorts of things, but especially about the links between music and math.\n",
      "SPEAKER_03: It was a great conversation. I still think about it a lot, actually, as well.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01: We ran out of time in that conversation and never got around to talking about another passion of yours, which is investigating the connections between literature and math. And I have to say, when you told me you were writing a book on that topic, I was a bit incredulous because off the top of my own head, I couldn't come up with a page worth of connections between literature and math, much less a book.\n",
      "SPEAKER_03: I have had a blast doing this book because when people say, what? What do you mean there are connections? And then it's a great joy to be able to show people what they are. And this is why it's been so much fun. Mathematics is really our way of understanding structure and pattern. And if you think about it from that angle, then you start to see, okay, literature has, for example, poetry. I can see that there's structure in poetry. You can see that there are rhythms and patterns. And so perhaps it's believable mathematics is involved there. And it is. Poetry is full of mathematics. But there's also structure in all sorts of literary works, in novels. There are people that use structures in their work consciously, but it's also there even without thinking about it.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Let's start with maybe the simplest form of structure that authors impose on their work, and I guess that might be haiku?\n",
      "SPEAKER_03: So, Japanese poetic forms don't have what we might use in English and Western poetry, which might be rhyme schemes and things like that. In a form like a haiku, it's all about counting the sounds. We sometimes say syllables, that's not quite exactly what it is, but sounds might be a better term. And in a haiku, you have 17 sounds, and it's split into 5 and then 7 and then 5. And if you're a mathematician, hearing those numbers 5, 7, 17, it jumps out at you that they're prime numbers. Right? So why 17? Why not 16? Or why not some other number? Why is it split up into these three, another prime number, different parts? And thinking about it in terms of those choices that have evolved in the poetic form, you start to say, all right, so that five and seven, the first two parts of a haiku, that makes 12 sounds together. Actually, if you split it evenly, six and six, that's less of an interesting thing. It doesn't have this dynamic structure of leading onto five leads onto seven. It makes it just a little bit interesting, but also five and seven being prime, you can't break them up any further. You can't divide them by anything. So it makes for a cleaner break and it more emphasizes that little separation. So these are the kind of things you can notice and think about, even in that very simple constraint of 17 sounds.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01: It reminds me a little bit in our last conversation where you talked about the mathematics of vibration and how some combinations of sounds naturally sound good together.\n",

       "[\"Now, one of the most basic assumptions of economics is that constraints are bad, at least in classical economics. People are always better off, or at least no worse off, when you relax constraints.\\n\\nSo more money is better than less money, and more hours in the day would be better than fewer hours in the day. Do you think literature is an exception to that economic logic, that constraints really make it better? So I think there's some sweet spot, right? If you constrain everything, then you're trapped in a really rigid box. There's no room for you to be creative. With absolutely no constraints at all, you're out in the wilderness. But with a few simple constraints, like you might have in a poetic form, that doesn't stop you being creative. It spurs you to creativity. And so there's this great quote from the Irish poet, Paul Muldoon, where he said that poetic form is a straitjacket in the sense that straitjackets were a straitjacket for Houdini.\\n\\nThey give you something to push off from. They give you an impetus to be creative within the structure that you've got. I'm not sure how familiar you are with six-word stories, which are an extreme version of this constraint, stories that are told in their entirety in six words. And the most famous one, which is attributed probably falsely to Ernest Hemingway, is this one.\\n\\nI think it goes, for sale, baby shoes, never worn. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which I at least find to be an extremely haunting and powerful and memorable story because it says so much with so little. For sale, baby shoes, never worn. Yeah, exactly. And the brevity of it is part of the greatness of that tiny story.\\n\\nChekhov, his short stories are some of the greatest pieces of literature. There are what you can tell in a few pages. And with that restriction, I'm not going to give myself a whole novel. I'm going to tell this beautiful jewel, this crystalline perfection in a few pages. That makes it better. These short stories would not be better. As novels, they are perfect as short stories. My Freak and I was co-authors, Stephen Dubner. He started to get obsessed with these six-word stories, and he was invited to be part of a book where they asked famous authors to write their own memoir in six words. And I still remember his. It was on the seventh word He rested. which I find interesting because it reflects Stephen Dubner's identity as a writer and a creator, and also his unusual relationship with the Old Testament, because he's someone who converted to Judaism. But there's also something, I don't know, sacrilegious to it, because he's saying on the seventh word he rested, which is somehow making this direct comparison between himself and God. So it's, I don't know, it just makes me think, which I guess is the best you can hope for in six words. Wow, exactly. Now I really like that because as you're hearing the six words and you don't get it till the very final one, there is no seventh word and here's why, that tiny little story's told you.\\n\\nwhy we've stopped at six as well. It's fantastic, that. I love it. Exactly. So the people who took this constrained idea to their extreme, there was a French group of writers. What were they called again? The Oulipo. It's a shortening of the first two letters of Ouvoir et Littérature Potentielle, so Workshop for Potential Literature. And the Hundred Trillion Poems were by Raymond Connaught. He was one of the Oulipians. And they were all about exploring ways of making potential new kinds of literature with different constraints, really, mostly mathematical in nature.\\n\\nBut the most famous one, probably, is Georges Perec, who wrote a whole novel called La Disparition, which doesn't contain a single letter E. And this is a really good example where the first question probably anyone would ask is, why do that? And that's a really important thing to address because if we're just making up constraints and rules for no reason and playing intellectual games with them.\\n\\nBut that's what he was doing, right? Well, but it's more than that. The novel without the letter E, that wasn't the first book to be written omitting a single letter. So there was an earlier one which didn't use the letter E in the 1920s, but no one's heard of it.\\n\\nAnd I think the reason no one's heard of it is because it doesn't do anything cool with that restriction. Yes, it cleverly avoids using the letter E. It's a lot of work. It's very hard to do, but there's nothing in the story that's relevant to that. Whereas Perec's book, called La Disparation, The Disappearance, and in English it's called A Void, which are both clever titles, the book itself is about something that's missing, something that's disappeared. And then there are clues in the text. The characters know something's not right with the world. They're looking for something. There's an encyclopedia with 26 volumes, but volume five is missing. There's a hospital ward where there's no patient in bed number five because the fifth letter of the alphabet is E. And there are further layers towards this, so they work out eventually the characters, what's going on. But if you think about Georges Perrec himself, lots of letter E's in his own name, he lost both his parents during the Second World War. In French, you can't say family, mother, father. You can't say those words without the letter E.\",\n",

You can't say those words without the letter E.\\n\\nPerret cannot say his own name without the letter E. So this novel, which is about absence, disappearance, it has echoes within his own life around loss and things not being there. So that, for me, is what makes the use of a constraint interesting and worth doing if you actually do something with it's not just a random choice and that's exactly what we do in mathematics we don't just randomly think of rules we say okay these things seem to be what's happening in say geometry so you can set up some basic rules like we do in geometry at school this is what a line is this is what a point is this is what a circle is You need a starting point in mathematics. You don't choose the starting points randomly, otherwise it too would be just a sterile game. Mathematics is not that. Mathematics can help us understand so much because we don't do things at random.\\n\\nWe choose what our constraints are going to be, and then we play in a beautiful, wonderful playground of mathematics. So that is interesting what Perret did by leaving out the E. But then he wrote another book where he only used E's. Did he have a good story for that or was he just having fun? Well, he said it was all the E's that he hadn't used in La Disparation.\\n\\nIt was sort of lonely and sitting around waiting to be used. So, yeah, he wrote a book only with E's. And I think that was just, you know, having a bit of fun. And why not? We'll be right back with more of my conversation with mathematician Sarah Hart after this short break. So you masquerade as a normal person, but there's a point in your book where you reveal just how exceptionally weird and geeky you really are.\\n\\nDo you know what part of the book I'm talking about? It could be so many parts, Steve. There's one that jumped out. So there's something called fan fiction. And that's when regular people write stories involving popular fictional characters. But you propose something called fan-o-fiction. Yeah. Do you want to explain what fan-o-fiction is? So I was playing around with ideas around constraints, and when I mentioned this link between the constraints of poetry really giving us creative impetus to write beautiful sonnets or other kinds of poetic forms, and the constraints of geometry enabling us, those few little axioms that we start off geometry with, enabling us to prove beautiful theorems like Pythagoras's theorem. And so that got me to thinking, I wonder if there's a geometry-like constraint that I could play with and make a new form of potential fiction. It's a bit like your six-word stories. There is a kind of geometry, it's a particular mathematical structure called a projective geometry, where you only have a very few points. So, of course, in our normal world of geometry, there are infinitely many points. In this very strange structure called the Fano Plane, there are seven points and there are seven lines, and every line contains exactly three points.\\n\\nAnd it's got this beautiful structure. You can draw a little picture of this happening. It looks like a triangle with a circle inside it. And so what I did was to create a kind of literary form, which I'm just waiting for my Nobel Prize for literature here at this point. So points now become words, and lines are sentences. So the rules were, okay, there are only seven words that I can use. And I only allowed seven sentences. And every sentence has to contain exactly three of these words. So within that, I wrote this little story about some nonsense thing. But it was a really fun way to challenge myself to be creative, because if you've only got seven words and they've each got to appear in sentences, then some of those words have to do double duty as verbs and as nouns. So I think I had best as one of them. Best can be a verb. If you best someone, it means you come out top in a fight. Or it can be an adjective, right? The best show in the world, which is yours, of course.\"]"
